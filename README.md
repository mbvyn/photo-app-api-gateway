# Photo App API Gateway
The Photo App API Gateway repository is part of the larger photo-app application, which is built using Java and follows a microservices architecture based on the Spring framework. This repository focuses on the API gateway component, which acts as the entry point for external clients to access the microservices in the application.

## Overview
The Photo App API Gateway serves as a centralized entry point for all external client requests to the microservices in the photo-app application. It provides various functionalities such as request routing, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request/response transformation.

## Features
**Request Routing:** The API Gateway routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on the request path and other defined rules.

**Authentication and Authorization:** It handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific microservices.

**Rate Limiting:** The API Gateway enforces rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources by clients.

**Request/Response Transformation:** It performs request and response transformations to adapt between client-specific and microservice-specific data formats.

**Logging and Monitoring:** The API Gateway collects and logs relevant information about requests and can provide metrics for monitoring purposes.
